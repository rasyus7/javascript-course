    <!-- main idea of js
     1)save data, 2)generate html, 3)make it interactive -->

    <!-- things learned
    (to be frank backend part didnt really work out)
    1)Instead of functions, we use classes of cart-class.js 
    again we are creting objects but now usÅŸing the classes
    2)constructor=initalize and create an instance of an object
    everytime you create an object
    3)class=better way to generate an object(before we were using arrays
    with many key value pairs, thats why he calls them objects)
    4)in js # means private variable inside an object
    5)when coding make sure the methods that will be executed inside 
    the class has only private class identifier
    6)learned to convert an object into a class
    (using map)
    7)inheritence: avoid code dup by reusing the code
    8)make sure you use the correct private and public additions in the code
    
    lec18:callbacks, backend and async wait
    8)backend, callbacks and async wait
      (to be frank backend part didnt really work out)
      !!!most likely not working as server is like a buffer, not a real server
      1)backend:computer that manages data of a website
        how does it work? when we request for a item in amazon
        they save the data on a computer that is owned by amazon
        frontend: where the user sees things, html css of website

      2)https have 1 request and 1 response,
      you can see the network packages or messages
      send through HTTPS requests
      status code show is https request was successfull or not

      3)!!!using a browser to see a webpage = a GET request of HTTPS
    
      4)happens in product.js
      5)main thing about this kind of coding(using backend) is you have 
      to care about the callbacks
        1)send a request
        2)wait for a callback for a response, then run the code
        3)when you write code with testing cases, make sure
        that loading of data is done before the testing

      <!-- lesson 19
      1)Promises in JavaScript are objects used to handle asynchronous operations
        (e.g., fetching data). They represent the eventual result of an operation:
        fulfilled (success), rejected (error), or pending.
        fetch is a built-in function used to make HTTP requests to a backend server.
        resolves let us control when we go to the next step
      !!!main adv of promises 
        1)is that compared to callbacks, we have 
        less nesting thus easier to understand, 
        keeps the code flat
        2)we can control the flow with keyword("resolve")
        3)has function called "promiseAll" which the code inside the 
        array at the same time, which is not provided by callbacks
        4)saves the response in a variable! so then() can use it
        5)handle code better with fetch
      2)fetch:fetch is a built-in function used to make HTTP requests to a backend server.
        resolves let us control when we go to the next step
        1)much simpler compared to XMLRequest
        2)parses the fetched data into an array! easier to maintain
      -->

      <!-- lesson 20
      1)async=shortcut for all the promises, makes a function
      thats return promise, it is different compared to promises and fetch
      it uses a different way of syntax
      2)we have async, await in this one, it still returns a promise
      3)much easier to understand
      !!!USE ASYNCH AS IT IS THE META

      ERRORS:
      1)handle errors in js with TRY and CATCH
      2)also works for asynch code
      3)use try and catch only for unexpected errors s.a loading data
      from a website
      4)throw->throws an error, used for if else cases
      5)reject: lets us create error in future, included in promises

      BACKEND Section:
      Get: get data from backend
      Post: send data to the backend
      Put:
      Delete:
      In real world we send http requests to send the order to the 
      website servers

      URL Parameters:
      in tracking.html, we can save the data in url using:
      1)query parameters: ?key=value
      2)hash parameters: #key=value

      Why is tracking used?
      1)navigation and state management:
        -keep track of users actions and selections across multiple pages
        -allow users to bookmark or share specific states of the application
        -support forward/backward navigation
      2)analytics and user behaviour;
        -track where user come from
        -monitor which products they are viewing
